Please refer to [official documentation](https://docs.libp2p.io/guides/getting-started/go)

The following are examples of applications based on libp2p:

* [Web3 basic](https://pl-launchpad.io/curriculum/web3/objectives/)
* [IPFS basic](https://pl-launchpad.io/curriculum/ipfs/objectives/)

### Working examples

* [Self addressing](../cmd/selfaddr/main.go)
    * This example demonstrate the use of libp2p-go to extract IP address from your platform.
