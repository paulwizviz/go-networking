## Self Addressing

Here we use the standard library to obtain the network address.

* Source code
    * [Standard library](../cmd/stdlib/selfaddr/main.go) - Using the standard package
    * [Libp2p](../cmd/p2p/multiaddr/main.go) - Using libp2p
* Use this [runtime](../deployments/playground.yaml) to test the working example.
